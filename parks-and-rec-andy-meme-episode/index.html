Pin by Erin Coleman on April Ludgate My Hero Parks and rec memes From pinterest.com
He absolutely terrorizes the park system. The caption stems from a memorable quote uttered by andy dwyer, who is portrayed as an oblivious but lovable city worker in the fictional town of pawnee, in season 6 episode 16 a new slogan originally aired on march 13th, 2014. His alter egos are burt macklin, kip hackman, johnny karate, jonathan karate, and sargent thunderfist. We see the beginnings of andy and april&#39;s budding romance, as their interactions subtly hint at something deeper than friendship.

<p>Why mark brendanawicz only lasted 2 seasons. Parks &amp; rec is easily one of the best comedy television series of the 2010s, and it’s one that’s had a lasting impact on its fans.even if we can’t tune in for new episodes with leslie knope and the rest of the pawnee parks department anymore, most of us will jump at any chance to revisit the gang and their shenanigans — even if it’s just in the form of looking at memes. Summer catalog (2x20) this episode is adorable, and extremely exciting, because this is one of the places it all began. This is a talking place for all things dedicated to the show parks and recreation.</p>
