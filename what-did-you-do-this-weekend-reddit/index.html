Manager keeps asking this question every monday to every team member, we&#39;re a small team of 5 people and manager as well as the other 3 team members always go on for couple minutes about how they did a lot of stuff (they consume experiences like concerts, restaurants, museums, travel.) and i&#39;m happy just staying home and watching tv, gardening, playing games or reading. Survive to 3, immediately go to the gym, get back a bit before 5 and spend the next few hours multitasking between learning python and doing ffxiv dailies. Still need to do brakes, trans/diff fluids, weathertechs, ko2s (with bronze scs f5s if i can&#39;t control myself), oil pump gasket when i feel like it, and some bushings, and i&#39;ll call it done. Do this by hovering your palm over your nondominant hand while maintaining a steady stance in front of you.
