Its use in mining contributes to the activation of various processes that transform the geological environment, often causing irreversible changes in the properties and characteristics of all its components. It is the angle at which the wall of an open pit stands and it is determined by rock strength, geologic structures and water conditions. Photo i took at bingham.
