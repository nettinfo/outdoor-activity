Its use in mining contributes to the activation of various processes that transform the geological environment, often causing irreversible changes in the properties and characteristics of all its components. It is the angle at which the wall of an open pit stands and it is determined by rock strength, geologic structures and water conditions. Photo i took at bingham.

<p>This information should be about on both the deposit and the surrounded waste rock. Open pit mining is also called strip mining because the extraction process destroys vegetation, reduces habitats and pollutes the environment. Mining proponents argue that the process is more efficient, cost effective and safer than shaft mining. Everyone is preparing to get ready for mining, breaking rocks and plating copper.
