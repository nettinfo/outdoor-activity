Gululu the interactive bottle that keeps kids hydrated by Bowhead From kickstarter.com
Dehydration happens when there is not enough water in your body. For every number that is divisible by 3 you take a sip of water. The key is to make sure students stay hydrated by drinking at least eight cups of water per day or more if they’re spending time outside in the heat. Remind students of the importance of being hydrated during any type of exercise and wearing proper attire.
