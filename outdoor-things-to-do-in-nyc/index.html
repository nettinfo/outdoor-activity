Best outdoor activities for winter in NYC From matadornetwork.com
Nyc is big, bold, and beautiful. Among the newer attractions in nyc, the little island is a unique public park built atop an artificial island along hudson river park.

Summer is the season for festivals and you have a lot of choices.
