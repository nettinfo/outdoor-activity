What Is the Noise Control Act? (with pictures) From wisegeek.com
It comes in various sizes to accommodate all kinds of storage facilities and construction sites. Power supplies commonly have an adjustable output voltage range. A machine uses power but isn&#39;t necessarily electrical. In most cases, the input voltage is universal, accepting 85 to 264 vac, 50/60 hz and typical outputs are 5, 12 and 24 vdc with 24 v the most popular for industrial applications.
