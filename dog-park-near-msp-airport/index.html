<p>We've found 9 airport parking near msp airport such as americinn hotel and suites from $8.99 per day, offering free shuttle and advanced reservations with most recent customer reviews. It’s safe and secure, with 24/7 shuttle service. A motel/hotel where we can leave the car for 22 days for a reasonable price would also work. I believe it was excess airport commission land, iirc.
