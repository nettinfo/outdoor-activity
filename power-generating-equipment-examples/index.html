For example, nuclear power plants provide large quantities of reliable power with low levels of greenhouse gas emissions. An alternate name of an electric generator is a dynamo for transmission as well as the distribution of energy over power lines to different applications like domestic, industrial, commercial, etc. Typically, for such a thermal process, only about 1/3 of the raw energy (i.e., from coal) is converted into mechanical energy. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:1.
