6.) Canyon Trail Robbers Cave State Park Wilburton, OK Hiking spots From pinterest.com
The hike is 4.2 miles and is considered somewhat strenuous, but it&#39;s well worth the effort. These are some photos i took on the trail last fall (november 6, 2018). Take the trail to the west that includes class 3 boulder climbing before you reach the granite slab that is referred to as elk mountain trail summit. It’s at least an intermediate level trail, with some areas that might be considered expert level.
