<p>For example, a condensing economizer can be paired with a boiler to recover heat from fluid that is hot, but not hot enough to be used in the boiler itself. Energy efficiency is the practice of using less energy to provide the same amount of useful output from a service (such as heating water, lighting, or cooling a fridge). Resources that consume high energy must be used to their full potential. They are generally used to control the flow of either substance, but they are also used for a variety of other jobs.
