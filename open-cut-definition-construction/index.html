<p>The tunneling procedure is more economical in nature, compared to open cut trench method when the depth is beyond a limit. The surface life or ground activities like transportation are not disturbed when tunneling is undergone. It can also be used to form a level surface on which to build, as elevated sections of the site are ‘cut’ and moved to ‘fill’ lower sections of the site.
