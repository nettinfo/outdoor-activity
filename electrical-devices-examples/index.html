<p>Electrical engineering for medical devices is exacting to say the least, and especially so for devices used in an operatory environment. For example, printer, braille reader, plotter, etc. Electric(al) devices are devices that functionally rely on electric energy (ac or dc) to drive their core parts (electric motors, transformers, lighting, rechargeable batteries, control electronics). Thermoelectric devices are a way of converting temperature to energy. Assistive Technology What is assistive technology?.</p>
