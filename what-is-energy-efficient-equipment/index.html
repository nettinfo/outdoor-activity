Efficiency is referred to the usage of something in such a way that it provides us with maximum productivity and the wastage of that thing is minimum. Many people work from home at least one day per week. The energy technology list ( etl) is a government list of energy efficient plant and machinery. Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called energy efficiency, is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services and can also reduce effects of air pollution.
